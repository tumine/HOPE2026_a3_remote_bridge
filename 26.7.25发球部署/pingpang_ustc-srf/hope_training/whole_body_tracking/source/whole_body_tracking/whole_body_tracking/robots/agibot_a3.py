"""Agibot A3 robot configuration for the HOPE whole-body task.

31 controllable DOF (hands excluded): waist yaw/roll/pitch (3), neck yaw/pitch (2), each arm 7
(shoulder pitch/roll/yaw, elbow, wrist roll/pitch/yaw), each leg 6 (hip pitch/roll/yaw, knee,
ankle pitch/roll). The right wrist carries the paddle.

Nothing here touches the filesystem at import time: :class:`ArticulationCfg` only stores the asset
path string, so the task registers and imports fine *without* the asset present. The path is only
resolved when an environment is actually instantiated for training. Supply your own A3 URDF/USD
under :data:`~whole_body_tracking.assets.ASSET_DIR` (see that package's README).

The actuator gains, effort/velocity limits, armature and the standing pose below are EXAMPLE values
that produce a reasonable starting point — transcribe your robot's real values before training a
model you intend to deploy.
