"""Loader for the shared no-spin ball-physics configuration.

Every physical constant used to build the table-tennis scene (ball, air drag, table / net geometry,
bounce materials) is sourced from a single repo-level file, ``configs/ball_physics.yaml``, so that
training, the planner, and the MuJoCo evaluator all agree on one world. This module locates and parses
that file and exposes it as a plain nested ``dict``.

Resolution order for the config file:

1. the ``HOPE_BALL_PHYSICS_CONFIG`` environment variable, if set (absolute path), else
2. the first ``configs/ball_physics.yaml`` found while walking up from this file toward the repo root.

The values below in :data:`DEFAULTS` are the **clean no-spin** subset of the real fitted ball-capture
values and double as documentation of the schema this package reads. Whenever ``configs/ball_physics.yaml``
is present it is authoritative and overrides these defaults key-by-key (a shallow section is deep-merged),
so the file — not this module — is the single source of truth. The defaults only keep the package
importable and unit-testable on their own.

Units: SI (meters, seconds, kilograms, radians). Coordinate frame: +x forward, +y left, +z up
(right-handed), with z = 0 at the table surface. There is **no spin anywhere** in this model: the ball
state is fully described by position and linear velocity.
