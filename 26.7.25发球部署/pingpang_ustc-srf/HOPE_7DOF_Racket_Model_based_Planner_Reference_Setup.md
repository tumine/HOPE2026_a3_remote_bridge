## Overview

This document provides a reference implementation of the model-based planner (Stages 1–3) for computing the desired 7-DOF racket state — interception position, velocity, and face orientation — for a humanoid ping-pong player. The planner operates within the HOPE canonical world frame defined in the companion document *HOPE Motion Capture System Reference Setup for Ping-Pong Arena*.

The planner consumes ball position data from the HOPE motion capture system and produces a `RacketCommand` message specifying where and how the humanoid's paddle must arrive to return the ball. Per the HOPE racket exclusion policy, the paddle's actual pose is **never measured by the motion capture system**; the motion capture system tracks only three categories of objects — the table origin frame (PPT), humanoid base_links (P1, P2), and the ping-pong ball. Each humanoid must achieve the commanded racket state through its own forward kinematics from `base_link` + joint encoders and whole-body controller. See companion *HOPE Motion Capture System Reference Setup* (Section 3.1 — Racket Exclusion Policy) and *HOPE WBC Simulation Training Reference Setup* (Section 2.8 — Racket Mount Kinematics).

## 0  Prologue — Scope and Implementation Notes

### 0.1  Scope

This document covers the model-based planner spanning **Stages 1–3** — ball state estimation, trajectory prediction, and racket target planning — providing the complete algorithmic pipeline from ball position observations to the desired racket state `(p̂_intercept, v̂_racket, n̂_racket, t_strike)`.

Stage 4, the whole-body controller (WBC), is outside the scope of this planner reference. Each HOPE team is expected to provide their own WBC or IK-based controller to execute the planner's racket commands.

All code in this document is a clean-room implementation derived from the equations and design described in the following sections.

### 0.2  Coordinate Frame

The HOPE reference frame places the origin at the **near-side left corner of the table surface**, as defined in the HOPE Motion Capture System Reference Setup. The HOPE frame follows ROS 2 REP 103 (Y-left, ENU): X toward the opponent (P2), Y to the left from P1's perspective, Z up. The virtual hitting plane is at `x = x_hit ≈ 0.0 m`, and the opponent half-center is at `x = 2.055, y = −0.7625`.

### 0.3  Implementation Notes

The following table documents key design decisions in this reference implementation. These are deliberate choices for accuracy and robustness appropriate to a reference design.

| Aspect | This implementation |
|--------|---------------------|
| **World frame origin** | P1 near-side left corner; avoids negative coordinates for on-table positions |
| **Integration method** | Explicit Euler with dt = 1 ms; adequate accuracy at 1 kHz for ~7.5 cm racket tolerance |
| **Bounce event timing** | Linear sub-step interpolation within the crossing timestep improves temporal accuracy when z crosses zero mid-step |
| **Bounce detection in state estimator** | Three-sample z-height pattern: z descends through threshold then rises, avoiding premature triggering on the ball's descent before actual contact |
| **Table bounds for bounce** | Ball center bounds expanded by ball radius (±20 mm) to handle edge bounces where the ball center is slightly outside the table edge but the ball surface contacts the table |
| **Net clearance validation** | Checks both height clearance and Y-axis net extent; auto-adjusts flight time if clearance fails |
| **Racket orientation output** | `normal_to_quaternion()` utility with optional roll constraint, for IK-based controllers that need a full orientation quaternion rather than just the velocity vector |
| **Drag calibration procedure** | Provided as `calibrate_ball_physics()` with least-squares fitting |
| **Post-bounce kinematics** | Quadratic position correction (½a·dt²) in the remaining sub-step after a bounce ensures consistent second-order accuracy across bounce boundaries |
| **Hit-plane crossing interpolation** | Interpolation uses post-bounce state if a bounce occurred in the same timestep, ensuring interpolation spans a continuous flight arc and preventing blending of pre-bounce and post-bounce velocities in rare edge cases |
| **Smoothed position estimate** | Polynomial value at t=0 (latest timestamp) returned as smoothed position, which may differ from raw measurement by ~2 mm; polynomial denoising improves velocity accuracy at the cost of a small position offset |

### 0.4  What Is Not Implemented

The following aspects are outside the scope of this planner reference:

- **Spin dynamics** — Spin is neglected in this reference design. Magnus force is absent from this implementation.
- **Strategic target selection** — The planner always aims for the opponent's half-center. No game-state-dependent target variation.
- **Whole-body controller (Stage 4)** — Each HOPE team provides their own controller.
- **Forehand/backhand selection** — Swing type is a WBC decision (e.g., based on the sign of the ball's Y position relative to the robot), not a planner output.
- **Racket pose measurement** — Per the HOPE racket exclusion policy, the paddle is never tracked by the motion capture system. The motion capture system provides exactly three categories of tracking: the table origin frame (PPT), each humanoid's `base_link` (P1/P2), and the ball. The planner outputs a desired racket state; achieving it is the robot's responsibility via forward kinematics from `base_link` + joint encoders. See companion *HOPE Motion Capture System Reference Setup* (Section 3.1) for the exclusion policy and enforcement, and *HOPE WBC Simulation Training Reference Setup* (Section 2.8) for the fixed wrist mount kinematics that make this work.

## 1  HOPE Canonical World Frame

This section restates the frame convention from the HOPE Motion Capture System Reference Setup for completeness. Both documents use the same coordinate system.

| Axis | Direction | Range on table surface |
|------|-----------|------------------------|
| **X** | Toward P2 (opponent), along table length | 0 → +2.74 m |
| **Y** | Left (from P1's perspective), along table width | 0 → −1.525 m |
| **Z** | Up (vertical) | 0 = table surface |

Key landmarks:

| Landmark | X (m) | Y (m) | Z (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|-------|
| Origin (P1 near-side left corner) | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| Net center line | 1.37 | −0.7625 | 0.0 |
| P1 half center | 0.685 | −0.7625 | 0.0 |
| P2 half center | 2.055 | −0.7625 | 0.0 |
| Floor below origin | 0.0 | 0.0 | −0.76 |
| Virtual hitting plane (planner) | x_hit ≈ 0.0 | — | — |
| Robot nominal standing position | ≈ −0.5 | ≈ −0.7625 | −0.76 (floor) |

## 3  Stage 1 — Ball State Estimation

The motion capture system delivers ball center position `p(t) = [p_x, p_y, p_z]` at 360 Hz via `motion_capture_tracking`. Velocity is not directly observed. A 2nd-order polynomial is fit to the most recent N = 31 samples and differentiated analytically.

### 3.1  Theory

For each axis independently, fit:

```
p(t) = a₂ t² + a₁ t + a₀
```

via least-squares over the 31-sample window (~86 ms at 360 Hz). The velocity estimate is:

```
ṗ(t) = 2 a₂ t + a₁
```

The buffer is cleared on each detected table bounce to prevent the polynomial from fitting across the velocity discontinuity.

**Note on smoothing**: The polynomial value at the latest timestamp is the smoothed position estimate, which may differ from the raw measurement by up to ~2 mm. This is by design and improves velocity accuracy.

### 3.2  Implementation

```python
class BallStateEstimator:
    """Estimate ball position and velocity from motion capture position stream.

    Maintains a sliding window of recent position measurements and
    performs a least-squares polynomial fit to extract smoothed
    position and velocity estimates.

    Bounce detection uses a three-sample pattern (descend → contact → rise)
    to identify the actual table impact event and clear the buffer.

## 4  Stage 2 — Ball Trajectory Prediction

Given the current ball state `(p, v)` from Stage 1, forward-integrate the trajectory using:

- **Flight dynamics**: quadratic aerodynamic drag plus gravity
- **Bounce dynamics**: diagonal restitution matrix at `z = 0` contacts

The output is the predicted ball position and velocity at the moment it crosses the virtual hitting plane at `x = x_hit`.

### 4.1  Flight Dynamics

```
a = −k |v| v + g         where g = [0, 0, −9.81] m/s²
```

Integrated with explicit Euler at `dt = 0.001 s` (1 kHz).

### 4.2  Bounce Model

```
v⁺ = C v⁻    where C = diag(C_h, C_h, −C_v)
```

Position z is clamped to zero at the bounce instant. Only bounces within the table surface bounds (expanded by ball radius for edge contacts) are applied.

## 5  Stage 3 — Racket Target Planning

Given the predicted ball state at the hitting plane from Stage 2, compute the desired racket velocity and orientation to return the ball to a target landing point on the opponent's side.

### 5.1  Desired Outgoing Ball Velocity

```
v_o = (p̂_land − p̂_intercept) / Δt  +  ½ g Δt
```

This is a simplified ballistic calculation neglecting drag during the return flight.

### 5.2  Desired Racket Velocity and Orientation

```
û = (v_o − v_i) / |v_o − v_i|              (racket face normal)
v̂_racket = [(v_o · û) + C_r (v_i · û)] / (1 + C_r) × û
```

### 5.3  Net Clearance Validation

The return trajectory must clear the net at `x = 1.37 m`, `z_net = 0.1525 m`, and the ball's Y at the net must fall within the net's lateral extent (table width + 0.15 m overhang on each side).

## 10  Known Limitations

1. **No spin model** — Spin-induced Magnus force is neglected in this reference design. This is the largest source of prediction error for balls with heavy topspin or sidespin.

2. **Drag-free return trajectory** — Stage 3 uses pure ballistic motion (no drag) for the outgoing velocity calculation. For high-speed returns, the actual landing point will undershoot slightly.

3. **Fixed virtual hitting plane** — The hitting plane is at constant x. A more advanced planner would optimize the interception point over the robot's reachable workspace.

4. **Planar restitution model** — The diagonal bounce matrix assumes no spin transfer or tangential friction.

5. **Single landing target** — The planner always aims for the opponent's half-center. Strategic target variation is outside the scope of this reference.

6. **Implementation-specific numerical choices** — Numerical choices such as the integrator, bounce handling, and timing are specific to this reference setup and may be tuned differently in other systems.
