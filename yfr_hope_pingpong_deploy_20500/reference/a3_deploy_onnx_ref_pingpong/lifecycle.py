"""Continuous multi-rally swing lifecycle.

Per tick the runner advances one state machine that turns the latest
``RacketCommand`` and the robot state into the strike goal fed to the observation:

    ready -> swing -> follow-through -> recovery -> ready -> (next task_id)

Contract points enforced here:
  * A new ``task_id`` engages a swing (only from ready or recovery). ``swing_side``
    is locked for the whole task.
  * A higher ``task_revision`` under the active ``task_id`` updates the target and
    time-to-strike, but only before contact.
  * There is exactly one swing per ``task_id``.
  * Between balls the robot pose, joint state, and policy history are NOT reset --
    the lifecycle never touches them, it only chooses what goal to observe.
  * Recovery is in-place recentring only (a fixed ready reach); it is never
    locomotion or footstep planning.

The reference clock: ``time_to_strike`` is seeded from the command and is emitted
for the current pre-physics observation.  :meth:`advance` is called only after the
physics transition, where it counts down by ``dt``.  This matches Isaac's
``obs_t -> action_t -> physics transition -> obs_(t+1)`` convention and avoids
showing the actor a target one control tick earlier than the planner supplied.
